## *Thanks for being here! 👋🏻🥰* 

### My name's Mariesa and I'm a Full-Stack Developer! 💻
#### 😎 My pronouns are she/her and you can pronounce my name like *muh-ree-suh*.
#### 🎉 *Fun Fact* my husband opened me up to the idea of changing my career to software development, because of my passion and creativity in crafting survival games like Minecraft! 🎮 *(I was the designated base builder)*
#### 🎨 My favorite thing about programming is that I get to be creative in a medium other than the typical pen / pencil / paintbrush! 
#### 👷🏻‍♀️ I'm currently on week 8 of 12 of General Assembly's Software Engineering Course and am projected to graduate November 15th 👩🏻‍🎓
#### 📚 In this unit we're diving into the back end and learning *MongoDB* and *Express*!
#### 📬 The BEST way to reach me is via email @ mariesa.oconnell.dev@gmail.com
