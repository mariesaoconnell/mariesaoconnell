## *Thanks for being here! üëãüèªü•∞* 

### My name's Mariesa and I'm a Full-Stack Developer! üíª
### I'm currently transitioning into a career as a developer, with a background in auto insurance claims and over half a decade of professional experience building my skills in problem solving, communication, time management and being solution oriented. 
### I started my development journey in 2009, when I discovered HTML and CSS, I continuted taking classes on web development, but didn't realize that it was a career option until 2021, which is when I chose to leave my career in insurance and pursue my education full time. I graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program in November of 2021 and my goal is to continue to build upon the skills I graduated with and expand my skillset with the languaes and frameworks that interest me. 
## When I'm not programming, I'm probably gaming or chasing my three German Shepherds around my house with a vacuum. (In efforts to manage the fur lol)
